My collection of amphetamine songs

Catherine wheel - Crank - (Lyrics)

Daycare swindlers - Crystal meth - (Lyrics) <- No other song more accurately describes the feeling I get from speed

Eve 6 - Amphetamines - (Lyrics)

(The) Fall - Totally wired - (Lyrics)

Holy modal rounders - If you'll want to be a bird <- Written by the singers wife while she was speeding

Lemonheads - My Drug Buddy <- Evan Dando (the singer) used lots of drugs while he was in the Lemonheads. He finally got caught up in alcohol abuse (30-40 drinks a day). These days though, he claims he only smokes pot. Good for him.

Mark Foggo - Speeding my life away

Mark Lanegan band - Methamphetamine blues - (Lyrics)

Mink Deville - Let me dream if I want to (amphetamine blues)

Rocket From the Tombs - Amphetamine

Sisters of mercy - Amphetamine logic - (Lyrics + guitar tab) <- This song has somewhat managed to capture the dark feeling of a comedown. Andrew Eldritch, the singer, once claimed that the he and the other members of the band probably held some world records in amphetamine abuse back in the early eighties.

Small faces - Here comes the nice - (Lyrics + guitar tab) <- The song strangely managed to escape an airplay ban in the UK when it was released. The tile is a wordplay on the American comedian Lord Buckley's "Here come the Nazz".

Steve Wynn - Amphetamine - The best car driving song ever!

Third eye blind - Semi charmed kind of life

Toys that Kill - Amphetamine street

Vibrators - Amphetamine blue - (Lyrics) <- My all time favorite speed song.
