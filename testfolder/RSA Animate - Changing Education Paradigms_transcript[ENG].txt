0:17
is reforming
0:18
public education for two reasons for it
0:21
the first one is economic people trying to fit workout
0:24
how do we
0:26
educating
0:27
our children to take their place in the economy is the twenty first century how
0:30
do we do that
0:31
in the recount anticipate what economy will look like at the end of next week
0:37
as the recent turmoil
0:40
how do we do that
0:42
the second-lowest cultural
0:44
every country on earth on earth is trying to figure out how do we
0:48
educate our children so they have a sense of cultural identity and
0:51
so that we can pass on the cultural genes of art
0:54
communities
0:54
while being part of the process of globalization happy
0:58
square that circle
1:00
the problem is that trying
1:01
to meet the future
1:03
by doing what they did in the past
1:05
and on the way that alienating
1:07
millions of kids who don't see any
1:09
purpose in going to school
1:11
when we went to school
1:12
we work and there was story which is if you work hard and did well
1:16
got a college degree you would have a job
1:18
optics don't believe that
1:20
and the right not to bother
1:21
you're better having particularly the not it's not a guarantee anymore
1:25
a particular not if the with
1:28
marginalize has mostly things that you think are important about yourself
1:31
but some people say we have to raise families if this is a breakthrough
1:35
button ready to get such we should
1:38
why would you like them
1:39
internet
1:40
hyped haven't come across an argument that the safety of learning
1:44
but raisin and of course we should racing
1:46
the problem is that the current system education was designed
1:51
and conceived
1:53
unstructured four different
1:56
it was conceived
1:58
in the intellectual
1:59
culture
2:00
of the enlightenment
2:02
and in the economic circumstances of the industrial revolution
2:06
before the myth of the nineteen century there were no systems of public
2:09
education
2:10
not really a minute ago did you get to my jesuit sooner if if you have the
2:13
money
2:14
but public education payed for from taxation
2:18
compulsory to everybody in three at the point of delivery i was a revolutionary
2:21
idea
2:22
and many people
2:24
objected to they said that not possible
2:27
for many street kids working class georgia benefits from public education
2:31
very capable of learning to read and write and why we spending time on this
2:35
has also built into the whole series of
2:37
uh... assumptions about social structuring capacity it was driven by an
2:41
economic impact of all the time
2:44
but running right through it
2:46
was an intellectual
2:48
model of the mind
2:50
which was essentially unlike mindy of intelligence
2:53
the real intelligence consists in the scholastic assessment opera deductive
2:56
reasoning
2:57
on the knowledge of the classics originate
2:59
what we come to think of as academic
3:02
ability
3:02
and this is deep in the gene
3:04
a public education at the ready to types of people academic a non-factor demic
3:09
small people are not smart people
3:11
on the contents of that is that many brilliant people think they're not
3:16
because they've been judged against this particular view of the month
3:19
so we have a tenth of us
3:21
economic an intellectual
3:23
and mike
3:25
this model
3:26
has caused chaos
3:28
and many people's minds it's been great for some dripping people benefited
3:32
wonderfully from it
3:33
but most people
3:36
instead accepted this
3:37
this is the modern academic and its as myspace
3:40
at its best fictitious
3:42
this is the play golf eighty h d
3:47
this is a map of the concerns that lady h_d_
3:50
in america or prescriptions
3:52
for a p_h_d_
3:54
don't mistake me i don't mean to say
3:56
there was no such thing
3:57
as attention deficit disorder
3:59
i'm not qualified to serve the risk such a thing
4:02
i know the great majority of psychologists and children pediatrician
4:05
think there is such a thing
4:07
but still amount of disco debate
4:11
but i do know for a fact
4:13
is it's not an epidemic
4:15
these kids are being medicated
4:18
as routinely as we have apostles taken it
4:21
and on the same
4:22
whimsical bases and for the same reason medical
4:27
all children are living in the most intense is stimulating period in the
4:30
history of the s
4:33
that being besieged with information
4:36
upholstered tension
4:38
every platform computers
4:40
from my iphone some advertise golden's from hollister television channels
4:45
and what penalizing them out to getting distracted
4:48
from what
4:50
boring stuff
4:52
at school
4:53
for the most part
4:54
it seems we cannot occurrences totally but this is a dat has risen in parallel
4:58
with the growth of standardized testing
5:01
these kids are being given birth to end and at all in all manner of things
5:05
often quite then just rugs
5:07
to get them focused in combat
5:10
but according to this
5:11
attention deficit order
5:13
increases as you travel east across the country
5:16
people start losing interest in oklahoma
5:20
here
5:24
they can hardly think straight in arkansas the completely
5:31
him amber a separate reasons for that i believe the
5:36
it's a fictitious
5:37
epidemic
5:38
if you think it's the arts
5:41
another instance exclusivity arts i think it's also true science
5:45
elements for them
5:46
i said i walked into the because they all of the victims of this mentality
5:49
currently
5:52
the alts
5:54
especially address
5:55
beyond all
5:57
aesthetic
5:58
experience
5:59
anesthetic expenses one which or senses
6:02
all operating that peak
6:03
when your present in the current moment
6:05
when your resonating with the excitement of this thing that your
6:09
experiencing
6:10
when you are fully alive
6:12
and anesthetic is when you shake your senses off
6:16
and get yourself to what's happening
6:19
and a lot of these drugs
6:22
we're getting octial mtr education
6:24
bike and it's surprising them
6:26
and i think we should begin exact opposite we shouldn't be previously we
6:28
should be waking them up
6:30
to what they have inside themselves
6:32
but the model analysis
6:34
it's finally we have
6:35
that's just a magician that is modeled
6:39
the interests and extremism
6:42
and in the image of it
6:43
i could be further examples
6:46
stores also pretty much organize contract reminds upbringing that
6:49
walls separatism it is
6:51
specialized in two separate subjects
6:53
uh... we selected children by batches
6:57
you know we put them through the system by age group
7:00
why do we do that
7:01
no why is that this assumption
7:03
that the most important thing kids have in common is helpful dale
7:07
you know it's like the most important about was that they could manufacture
7:12
well i know kids were much better than other kids in the same age in different
7:15
disciplines
7:16
or different times the day
7:18
all bets in smaller groups in the mountains
7:20
orton basil to be alone
7:22
if you're interested in modern london you don't starkness production line
7:25
mentality
7:27
it's essentially bob conformity in increasing its about that as you look at
7:30
this time last testing and
7:32
standardized curricula
7:33
and it's about time two thousand shin
7:35
i believe we're going to help the situation
7:38
that's what i mean about changing the paradigm
7:40
there's a great said even recently of divergent thinking
7:44
to discover the answer divergent thinking this is the same thing
7:48
as creativity
7:49
i define prejudiced if the process of having a ritual ideas that have fun
7:55
divergent thinking isn't a synonym
7:57
but its fate
7:58
and essential
8:00
capacity to creativity
8:02
it's the ability to see lots of possible answers
8:05
took action
8:06
what's a possibly interpreting the question
8:09
to think
8:10
whatever devoted public all actually
8:12
to think not just in loophole
8:15
converge in place
8:17
two-seat multiple answers not one
8:19
so i mean a test of this i mean one kind of product sample of the people might be
8:23
asked to say
8:24
how many uses can you think all four paper clip
8:28
part of routine questions
8:29
most of my complete ten or fifteen
8:32
people go to this might come with two hundred
8:34
and they do that by saying whoa put the paper clip between the foot tall in the
8:37
night of the film about
8:39
and i'd like to have to be a paper clip as we know jim none
8:43
now the test is like a them to fifteen hundred people it's been a book called
8:47
breakpoints beyond
8:49
and on the critical of the test if you scored above a certain level
8:53
you'd be considered to be a genius of divergent thinking
8:57
so my question to his walk
8:59
percentage of
9:00
the people tested of the fifteen hundred
9:03
saudi genius level for divergent thinking
9:06
i need to one more thing about them
9:08
these work kindergarten children
9:12
what percentage of genius apple
9:16
making a bet
9:17
ninety percent
9:18
now the thing about this wasn't so long to juvenile study
9:21
so they've been test at the same children
9:24
five years later
9:26
ages eight to ten what you think
9:29
they retested system again
9:31
five years later ages
9:34
thirteen to fifteen
9:35
defensive ten different
9:37
here
9:41
his tells an interesting story
9:43
because you can imagine a going away
9:46
you start off not being very good but you get better to get older
9:50
but the shows two things one is we all have this capacity
9:54
and to it mostly deteriorates
9:57
how often this happens these kids as the grown-up
10:01
but one of the most important things onto mine convinces the buy now they've
10:04
become educated
10:06
they know the spent ten years of school being told as one insights at the back
10:10
and don't look
10:13
fondled copy
10:14
because that's cheating
10:16
then outside schools that's called collaboration
10:21
this is an because teachers want it this way
10:23
it just because it happens that way
10:26
it's because it's been the gene pool of education
10:30
after think differently about him capacity
10:32
back to get over disposed conception of of academic non-academic
10:38
theoretical
10:39
vacation or
10:40
and see if what it is then
10:45
second after recognize that most great learning happens in groups collaboration
10:48
is the stuff of growth
10:50
if you've got a nice people in separate them in judge them separately
10:56
former kind of disjunction between them and then that to learning environment
11:00
of flatly
11:00
it's crucial it about the culture
11:03
of our institutions the habits of the institution
11:05
and the habitats
11:06
that they occupy
